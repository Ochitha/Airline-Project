# Airline-project-using-Python-and-R
A deep investigation of flight details for the years 2006-2007 was created, looking into cascading delays to and from airports using Python and R and identifying what the best time of day, week, month and year were the most profitable for airline companies. A machine learning pipeline was also created to assist in the identification of delays and allow for preventive measures.

The word document details and introduction to the data set and the 5 questions that have been answered using Python and R languages, showing profiency in both.

Data wrangling and cleaning were included in the first parts of each notebook and rmd file.

A final report detailing and analysing the output for each has also been included for further understanding.

Note that comments were used on both codes for R and Python to describe what was done for each process for anyone's easy comprehension.
